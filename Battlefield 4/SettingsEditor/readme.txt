Version 1.1 (November 2, 2013):
  Features:
    • You can now view and configure multiple key bindings for each control. For example, you could set the Z, K, and P keys all to the "Jump" action. Please note that this only works for buttons, not axis controls; this is due to a limitation in Battlefield 4.
    • Added a donation button to the About window.
    • Added a Fixes section, where you can read about the included fixes and workarounds for various Battlefield 4 problems.
    • Added a toggleable game fix for freelook, which removes the need for using the Freelook (Hold) button.
    • Added a game fix for the Freelook (Hold) control, which is normally hard-coded (locked) to a specific joystick key (the left trigger for Xbox 360 controllers) in Battlefield 4. This game bug has caused many players to have problems with their throttle down control.
    • Added game fixes for the following controls, which are bugged/broken in the Battlefield 4 in-game menu:
        • Select gadget 1.
        • Toggle gadget 1.
        • Spectator free camera rotate up.
        • Spectator free camera rotate down.
        • Spectator free camera rotate right.
        • Spectator free camera rotate left.
  Fixes:
    • Fixed an issue where the default key bindings would not be completely overwritten when there were multiple key bindings by default.
    • Fixed an issue with the invert vertical tank look setting.
    • Fixed a text mistake on the Help tab.
    • Removed the Gunner key bindings, as they are sadly no longer working in the current version of Battlefield 4. Gunner positions use the key bindings from the Vehicles tab.
  Improvements:
    • Improved the look and feel of the GUI.
    • A message box is now displayed when loading a profile.
    • Renamed the "Toggle weapon light" key binding to "Toggle weapon accessory", to indicate that it can also be used to toggle magnifiers, canted iron sights, etc.

Version 1.0 (October 29, 2013):
  Features:
    • Updated to work with the full release of Battlefield 4.
    • BF4 Settings Editor will now offer the user the option of automatically copying their settings over from the Battlefield 4 Beta.
    • The program window is now resizable. The last used window size will be saved and remembered for the next time the program opens.
    • You can now export your Battlefield 4 settings back to the older Battlefield 3.
    • When importing/exporting settings from/to Battlefield 3, the Battlefield 3 settings files will now be scanned for errors. The user can decide whether to have these files automatically repaired.
    • Added support for the following settings:
        • Award messages.
        • Game mode messages.
    • Added support for the following key bindings:
        • All spectator key bindings.
        • All vehicle aim relative key bindings.
        • Toggle minimap.
        • Menu.
        • Menu / Scoreboard (hold).
  Fixes:
    • Updated the default settings to match those of the full release of Battlefield 4. The default settings have been changed since the Battlefield 4 Beta.
    • Removed the "Off" option for the texture filtering setting, as this has been removed in the full release of Battlefield 4.
    • Fixed an issue with the joystick sensitivity setting, where it would be using a range of 0-1 instead of the expected 0-5.
    • Fixed a bug where dragging certain sliders to zero would cause them to become disabled.
  Improvements:
    • Improved the look and feel of the GUI.
    • Moved the scoreboard, full map, and zoom minimap key bindings from the Common tab to the Infantry, Vehicle, Jet, Helicopter, Gunner, and MAV tabs. This matches the in-game menu and the way the controls work in the full release.

Version 0.91 (October 8, 2013):
  Features:
    • DICE silently released a patch which changed the location of the Battlefield 4 Beta settings files. BF4 Settings Editor will now offer the user the option of automatically copying their settings from the old location to the new location.
  Fixes:
    • DICE silently released a patch which changed the location of the Battlefield 4 Beta settings files. BF4 Settings Editor now looks for the settings in the new location.
    • Fixed a bug where changing the system tray icon options would not properly update the icon's visibility.
